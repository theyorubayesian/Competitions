The challenge is to study the pattern of promotion in Yakub Trading Group and to make prediction on new data. 

Both the train and test data contain missing values and I explore several strategies of dealing with them. This was especially insightful. 

The dataset is also imbalanced, expectedly. Totally enjoyed the many journeys this challenge set me on.
